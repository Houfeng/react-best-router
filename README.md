# RBR - React best router

In larger React applications, it is usually necessary to use a Router to handle relationships between pages and navigate between them. Are you using other Router libraries? Have you encountered any areas that are not very useful? For example, defining nested routes can be cumbersome or problematic, or may not be concise enough to include features unrelated to routing, or may be incompatible between different versions

Over the weekend, I attempted to write a simpler and more user-friendly routing packet, focusing on the routing processing of React applications. I named this packet React best router, abbreviated as RBR.
