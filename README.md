# RBR - React best router

I often use React router, but it has some shortcomings, such as nested routing. It is not concise enough and includes some features unrelated to routing. At the same time, new versions of it are often incompatible.

Over the weekend, I decided to write a simpler and more user-friendly routing packet, focusing on handling routing in the React project. I named this packet React best router, abbreviated as RBR.

RBR focuses on solving the problem of routing processing in React applications. It is a minimalist routing library with four core APIs.
