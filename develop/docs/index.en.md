# Get started with RBR

## Introduction

For a long time, I have always used react-router, but it has some disadvantages, such as "nested routing" and so on. It is not concise enough and contains some functions that have nothing to do with routing. At the same time, new versions are often incompatible.

> 长期以来，我总是使用 react-router，但它有一些不太好用的地方，比如“嵌套路由” 等。它不够简洁，包含了一些和路由无关的功能。同时，新版本常常无法兼容。

One weekend, I decided to write a simpler and easier-to-use package, focusing on handling the router work in the react project. I named this package `react-best-router`, which can also be called simply `RBR`
